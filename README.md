SunEdison API
=============

PHP API wrapper for the SunEdison application to retrieve data  pertaining to customers’ solar systems.

The Client Connect API is a simple web services interface that can be used to retrieve data 
pertaining to customers’ solar systems. The interface provides the same data as displayed via the 
Client Connect web application, giving customers and authorized third-party users a way to 
retrieve their data and build additional functionality that makes use of the data from their fleets. 

This project provides an easy means to call upon that data.
